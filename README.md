![Alt text](src/assets/img/appPrintScreen.png?raw=true "App Printscreen")

"City weahter" is a simple weather forecast app, created in Angular 4. It displayes a list of predefined cities with main forecast information. By clicking on
the city name, a page with extended forecast data is displayed. Also, there is a search input, to search extended forecast data for any city in the world.

The forecast data is provided from openweathermap apis. 

The app is responsive.

Main features why I created this app:

- Angular 4
- Routing
- Components
- Search
- Get data from an API
